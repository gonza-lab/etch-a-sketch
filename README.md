# Etch a Sketch!
I have done this project to put into practice my knowledge of Javascript, CSS and HTML. Feel free to try the project and ask me questions. Regards!

It is a simple game, you can paint, in black and different colors. It has some functionalities, like showing the grid, deleting and resizing your drawing box.
