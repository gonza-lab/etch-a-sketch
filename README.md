# Etch a Sketch!
I have done this project to put into practice my knowledge of Javascript, CSS and HTML. Feel free to try the project and ask me questions. Regards!

It is a simple game, you can paint, in black and different colors. It has some functionalities, like showing the grid, deleting and resizing your drawing box.

## Thoughts
I really liked doing this project (they are my first exercises with DOM). Some functions I had to look for because I did not know them, such as generating a random number for the color random. What I do not like about my way of programming is that there are some functions and lines that could simplify them, I think that if I make a diagram of the operation of what I am going to do before programming it will turn out much better, and more orderly . I like clean code, it is one of the main things I want to have. I do not like the buttons it has, I feel that they do not go with aesthetics.

I would honestly like to work on this.
